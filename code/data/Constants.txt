FKLS1 - from data FKLS12014-12-04

      D remains constant at 40
      n changes from 10 to 300 by incrememnts of 10
      numTrials = 1000 per experiment.

      ****

      Assume that output is E[T] = c_1D + c_2D^2/n
      
	assumption confirmed, and so when D is constant at 40,
	we get linear interpolation is:

	   E[T] = 147.08007853 + 21567.89416092 / n
