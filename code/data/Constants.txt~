FKLS1 - from data FKLS12014-12-04

      D remains constant at 40
      n changes from 10 to 300 by incrememnts of 10
      numTrials = 1000 per experiment.

      ****

      Assume that output is E[T] = c_1D + c_2D^2/n
      
	assumption confirmed, and so when D is constant at 40,
	we get linear interpolation is:

	   E[T] = 147.08007853 + 21567.89416092 / n

FKLS2 - from data FKLS22014-12-05

      D remains constant at 40
      n changes from 10 to 200 by increments of 10
      f = x^2 + 1
      numTrials = 100

      ****

      Assume that the output is E[T] = log^2(n)(c_1D + c_2D^2 / n)
      
	assumption confirmed. 
	we get linear interpolation is:

	   E[T] = (log^2n+1)(222.93084857 + 19954.026486 / n)

Harmonic Search - from HarmonicSearch2014-12-06

	D remains constant at 10
	n changes from 10 to 200
	delta = 1
	numTrials = 100

	****

	Assume that the output is E[T] = c_1D + c_2D^3 / n

	  assumption confirmed? Should do more experments in high values of n
	  we get linear regression is:

	     E[T] = 148.08373684 + 2319.71263158 / n

	D remains constant at 40
	n changes from 10 to 200 by 10
	numTrials = 100

	****

	Assume that the output is E[T] = c_1D + c_2D^2 / n
	
	   we get an extra term, so that we only get a line when we plot
	   n^2T vs n,

	   	E[T] = 26460.31443609 / k + 151116.88421053 / k^2
